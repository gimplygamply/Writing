Patron primordial of [[World/Aspects/Lizerta]].

# Manifesting Form
Lathot manifests as the actual laws that dictate the interaction of all things. At the epoch of their creation, with the assistance of the Aspect [[World/Aspects/Creation]], they defined **Five** primordial laws of the universe. With these laws as the basis of the the world they bestowed them unto the other Primordials:

1. [[Anela, The Primordial Darkness#Laws Of Darkness|Laws Of Darkness]], bestowed unto [[Anela, The Primordial Darkness]].
2. [[Novun, The Primordial Light#Laws of Light|Laws of Light]], bestowed unto [[Novun, The Primordial Light]].
3. [[Linifa, Primordial of Incubation#Laws of Creation|Laws of Creation]], bestowed unto [[Linifa, Primordial of Incubation]].
4. [[Ylem, Primordial of Matter#Laws of Existence|Laws of Existence]], Bestowed unto [[Ylem, Primordial of Matter]].
5. [[#Laws of Time]], Bestowed unto themself.

A sixth law was created, to be gifted to [[Etyan, Primordial of Etya]] who vanquished it. Etyan whose body is what birthed Lathot and whose body encompasses the universe refused to have their existence controlled by another's creation. This sparked a rivalry between the two primordials, in the end Etyan compromised and dictated their own [[Laws Of Magic]] to appease Lathot.
