The first primal deity by Creation and gifted patron primordial of [[Etyo]], created as a conscious pool of Etyo from which the material for all other deities would be harvested from.

Etyan is the single largest remnant of Etyo apart from Etyo themselves. They are aware of all Etyo in the universe and delegates the movement of this Etyo, including the malformed aspect, Etyo, themselves.

# Manifesting Form
Etya has no physical form, instead they are an amalgamous blob and instead presents as a universe encompassing [[Laws Of Magic#Etyan Clouds|Etyan Cloud]]. it is the direct tether to [[Etyo]] that allows it's essence to be present in the world.

# Laws of Magic
They are also the barer of their own law, the [[Laws Of Magic]].
