The primal Deity of darkness and patron of [[Malaiza]].

# Manifesting Form
Anela presents in the world as the Black hole. A cosmically powerful, all-consuming entity.

# Vested interest in Etya
Being the patron of [[Malaiza]], they have a vested interest in returning all that exists to Malazia. Being a primordial, the control of Etyo frustratingly beyond their control. Though in the brief flutters of the universe that occur from the dark magic, they are able to direct that Etya into a proton sized black hole that immediately vaporizes the source, absorbing not just the Grail Holder but also their shard of Etyo, much to the satisfaction of Malazia.

# Laws Of Darkness
- Gravity
- Anti-matter
