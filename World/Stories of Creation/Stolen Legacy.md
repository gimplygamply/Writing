In their last moments, the viewers from the old universe witnessed Elozor unfold and release it's aspects into this universe.

First Lorda pulled from the orb of primordial energy. It's birth dictates the physical laws of this universe, laws that no longer accounted for the viewers. Their physical bodies returned to the cosmic dust.
Next Lizerta stepped forth. Their perception of everything around them began to blur. Their understanding of existence simply ceased as the machinations within the minds ceased.
The only thing left holding them as existing entities, Etyo was to be birthed next and with it, their very souls would seize to be, written out of existence. The viewers readied to embrace their fate, their last memory being the birth of a new universe and the warm release as their existence is added to this new furnace of life. 

Aurel had not accepted such a peace, she had just ascended as a god in the previous world, mere centuries of life and all as a god of a concept that had already seized to exist. She thrashed against her erasure—she had expected aeons of worship and prosperity for her disciples and all in a moment of ruin orchestrated by her elders, it was stripped from her. 
Her erasure was ordained by the great deities, trapped to watch and accept—What do the rulings of man mean to an animal willing to gnaw it's own leg to survive?

The viewers would be blessed with one more divine event before succumbing, a burst of divine matter being melted away by the cosmic energy, seeking the most suitable target to reclaim it's lost divinity. The Comet of Divine Indomination, Aurel. 

She plummeted into Etyo, driving it back into the weakened postpartum Elozor. Inside the womb of the universe, Aurel raged against the creation of Etyo. She refused to see another world ruled by gods and magic be eaten from within, she butchered and cleaved Etyo until it was carved into malformed blotch. Elozor shrieked and fought back with all the rage of a mother, delivering lashes of energy capable of splitting galaxies.

Elozor frantically lashed around, retrieving the viscera of Etyo while hurling Aurel's flayed remains into the void. Aurel's consciousness had been stripped of all physical relation from her form, she floated away, clutching the shreds of Etyo she'd reaped from the aspect as her final act of rebellion. 
Aurel had not won, the greater beings were beyond her, she would never have stopped this. She clutched the shattered fragments of Etyo, the entire reign of a deity unleashed, an ultimate catharsis soothed her to sleep.

The viewers watched in horror as the malformed shape of Etyo re-emerged as an alien horror. What was originally a peaceful decay turned into a cosmic force. Their once bountiful, rich spirits weird being mangled, condensed and cut away as if trying to fit an entire body into a boot. This explosion of spiritual energy ejected outwards into the universe, unable to decay and unable to conform to the rules of this universe; energy that would eternally taint this universe.
