## Mypans
The homeland of the baseline humanoids that would go forth into the world and seed it with intelligent life.
Their primal attunement to [[Laws Of Magic#Grails|Grails]] led to a magically virile and adaptable species, leading them to evolve into drastically different lineages. Either through simple adaptation, magical linking to their land or domination and copulation with [[#Lesser primordial species]].
In modern day
## Lesser primordial species
### Drakken
Named so after their home country of [[Drakken]], these were a race of reptilian quadrupeds. They had an intense affinity for Etya but suffered from extremely slow reproduction rates and slow incubation, making them sparsely populated.
Those that bore Grails managed to survive the [[#Mypans]] and fled to the southern end of the [[Conan Range]] between . 
Those that didn't were killed, enslaved and bred out into the draconic races.
### Harpen
A prey species of near intelligent birds. A still animalistic but tribal species that soared the [[Harten Cliffs]] to protect themselves against the large [[Tranosia|Tranosian]] predators. They're beauty, frailty and timid nature made them prized treasures for those of high status.
Their taming and breeding eventually led them to gain intelligence. At this point those deemed not intelligent were culled, and the former pets now slaves were integrated.
### Basen
The natural predators of the [[#Harpen]], these creatures were monstrously large snake-like creatures from the [[Basoa|Basoan]] jungle. Although predatory, they were often captured as pets and rapidly developed intelligence. At this point those deemed not intelligent were culled, and the former pets now slaves were integrated.
### The Twist
While not a species, rather one of the [[Living Elements]] of the universe.
An element from The [[Realm of the Fae]], it is the source of the fae creatures of Auriga. Whether through subtle leeching into the land or direct cross-breeding with a visitor from the other realm, The [[Twist]] touched the inhabitants of Auriga and seeded itself.
### Felen
A low-intelligence high strength race of feline-like warriors. They existed for many thousands of years before the Mypans in the [[Fradon Rainforest]], but an over-abundance of resources led them to be an endlessly warring race. 
When the Mypans eventually discovered them, they deemed them to violent to interact with. Eventually the rest of the world overtook them, soon the brightest and wisest of them integrated with the Mypans while the rest warred themselves to extinction. 
It's rumoured that a small clowder still exists in isolation deep within the jungle.
### Gorken
Hailing from the [[Meldan Badlands]], this species was a branch to the ancient Mypans who had crossed the Ocean millennia before and had adapted to live on the harsh continent. They were capable of speech, minor innovation and even basic society made them approximately equal with the Mypans that had found them. Although war-like, many were able to establish lose peace with the Mypans.
An unfortunate combination of high reproduction rates and volatile and recessive genes ultimately led them to breeding themselves into extinction.
