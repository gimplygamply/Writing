# In Chronological Order
## Mypan Cradle (150 kya)
	(Slice of Africa/Rome/South America)
- Homeland of the [[Primordial Species#Mypans|Mypans]].
- Warm and stable environment, but not so stable as to avoid evolution.
- They were the source of all **Humans**, and where ever they settled, Humans eventually evolved

## Dendain Peninsula (135-140 kya)
	(heavily forested, central Europe like)
- First land settled by the Mypans
While the majority of the Mypans would settle in [[Frada]], a fair majority would venture further into the peninsula. The Dendain Peninsula's thick forest became sources of the most fantastical and ancients legends and tales of beasts, monsters, cryptids and tricksters. In the end, those tales would hold far more truth than expected. 
The peninsula, once a year would pass through a pocket of space where the veil between The [[Realm of Reality]] and The [[Realm of the Fae]] grew thin. In certain places around Auriga, this was felt greater than others, thus the presence of fae creatures and the **Fairy and Satyr Races**
The peninsula experienced a mild warping of the veil. This warping allowed [[Twist]] and the occasional Fae creatures from the realm to leech into the earth. Those that braved the tales and legend would develop into the **Elves and Shifter Races**
- **Wood Elves** were the first to appear in the Dendain forests (135 kya)
- **Dark Elves** would later develop under the [[Meldan Underdark]] (20 kya)
- **High Elves** were Wood Elves that travelled further north into [[Eraden]] and south into [[Frada]](130 kya)
- Different **Lycanthrope Ancestor** developed in Dendain at about same time except:
	- **Weretiger** developed from the [[Fradon Rainforest]] around (20kya)
### [[Primordial Species#Felen|Felen]] Encounter 
At about the same time as the Dendainian settlement, the Mypans entered the [[Fradon Rainforest]]. However the hyper aggressive and more powerful Felen made it impossible to settle.
The Fellen society was warring and had everything they required in the jungle, thus, never developed greater ambitions to leave.

## Castlia Settlement (100 kya)
	(North-Eastern Balkans/Slavic)
While a majority of Castlia would be inhabited by the immigrated Mypans, those that ventured south soon settled in the [[Slaelic Bay]] (90 kya). The harsher, colder and mountainous environment led them to evolve into the **Dwarven and Rock Gnome** Race.
- **Hill Dwarves** developed first in the Castlian Hills in the south. (100 kya)
- **Mountain Dwarves** developed from Hill dwarves that migrated east into the mountains. (90 kya)
- **Druegar** developed alongside the Drow in the [[Meldan Underdark]]. (20 kya).

## Marland Settlement (100 kya)
	(Cold adapted viking(mostly)/polynesians Seafaring)

# Ronyan Settlement (90 kya)
	(LOTR hobbits and peace. Minor fae hub but essentially Swiss/Dutch like agricultural realm)
Rolling hills, minor [[Twist]] influence, sparse forest, abundant food and farming land made [[World/Auriga/Predna/Ronya/Ronya]] a peak candidate for stable and peaceful living. It's easy living conditions and stable environment gave way to the peaceful **Halfling, Changeling and Forest Gnome** races.

## Trepnyan Incursion (80 kya)
	(Central and Southern Africa style Jungle and bush)
### Tranosian back-migration (20 kya)
In the later millennia the Tranosian's would hear of [[Trepnya]] and it's more hospitable environment. This led to a back-migration of many Mypan descendants, but also the Tranosian native species such as [[Primordial Species#Harpen|Harpen]] and [[Primordial Species#Basen|Basen]]. Who by this point more resembled modern Aarakocra and Yuan-ti. From the isolated wetlands and swamps within [[Trepnya]], the **Kenku** race would develop from the migrated [[Primordial Species#Harpen|Harpen]].

## Altasian Settlement (80 kya)
	(Korean/Japanese non-isolationist scientist and Grail enthusiast)


## Midin Settlement (70 kya)
	North African, Morroco/Egypt/Slight etheopian style
### Miland Settlement (60 kya)
- Naval settlement
- Plenty of Hard-to-navigate natural docs made it a practically impenetrable vassal of Midin
## Braelid bowl incursion (50 kya)
	(Isolationist chinese/Han style spiritualists)
### Cryro Resources Bank (40 kya)
A Hyper-rich mountainous region, although extremely inhospitable to Mypans. The settlers of Braelid, unaware of resources and intensely bigoted and superstitious exiled all their undesirables to Cryro. Eventually, pockets would form around more hospitable areas.
Through some Etyan force, Natural development, divine influence or spiritual realization, the superstitions of the Braelid people would take the form of the **Tieflings**.
### Anchian Passage (30 kya)
	(Tibetan)
- Uneventful mountainous region
- thought to be worthless
- eventually a reliable route is found to Orgya
### Orgyan Mysticical (4 kya)
- A peculiar tropical paradise.
- Lower elevation regions are made up of rainforest while higher altitudes experience a cold but never frozen land.
- It became the primary holy and royal land of the Brealic people.

## Slaelid (50 kya)
	(Eastern European Slavs/Rusviking)
- Ancient cold forests
- Massive landmass
- Most races live towards the center but not so close as to upset the Slealic Dwarves that had already rooted themselves in the mountain.
### Slenland (40 kya)
	Basically iceland but if it was Russian

## Fernir Suicide
	Hardcore spirtual survivalists in tribe like arrangements
- First settlement of the northern continent
- Failed several times
- Eventually managed a survivable foothold when the Mypans were accompanied by Elves and Dwarves.

## Transosian incursion (50 kya)
	(One-piece/pirate nations of criminal like slavers)
### West-Tranosian Isles (50 kya)
### Tran'koa (45 kya)
#### Basoa (30 kya) and the Harten Cliffs
Homes of the [[Primordial Species#Basen|Basen]] and the [[Primordial Species#Harpen|Harpen]] who were initially enslaved but later migrated back to [[Trepnya]] and eventually the rest of [[Predna]] where they would develop into the **Yuan-ti and Aarackockra** respectively.
### East-Tranosian Isles (43 kya)

## Conto (41 kya)
	Holy trade state, new-world-esque kingdom

## Drinesia (35 kya)
	Oceanic farmers and proud workers who have formed several Islan powers that constantly seek power over one another, much to the disdain of mainlanders.

## Eastern Gloven Tundra (35 kya)

## Western Gloven Tundra (30 kya)
The vast icy mountains here led to a group of the hardest survivalist on the planet forming. The **Goliath** Race

## Drakken (30 kya)
	Noble preservationist with gold obsession
The land of [[Drakken]] was the Mypans first encounter with an intelligent species, the name-sake of the land, the [[Primordial Species#Drakken|Drakken]]. Who began the race war is unclear, but despite greater power, the far greater reproduction rates, innovation and determination of the Mypans devastated the Drakken to the brink of extinction.
The remaining population was taken as slaves or fled east to [[Daggona]]. Eventually their low numbers meant they were forced to cross-breed with Mypans in order to continue their bloodlines. This eventually led to the **Dragonborne** race.

## Fradon Jungle Expeditions (30 kya)
After years of warring the [[Primordial Species#Felen|Felen]] had effectively sent each other extinct. By this point many of the Felen that attempted to seek refuge from the carnage had integrated into the Mypan lineage as the **Tabaxi** race.
The Mypans eventually moved into the Jungle, remaining Felen were unable to hold off the wave of Mypans. It's believed that the Felen devolved into the big cats, although a minor enclave has taken to hyper-isolationism in the Dorgan mountains in order to survive.

The humid and tropical nature of the eastern Savannah resulted in an alternative evolution of the Basen, the **Lizardfolk**. A race of hardy, ruthless and primitive adept survivalists.

# Burtan Habitation (25 kya)
	Pascifist artists and farmer

## Haurtin Settlement (25 kya)
Largest Northern Settlement

## Stellen Expidition (20 kya)
	Sparsely populated dwarven settlements each with massively unique cultures. Not isolationist but so isolated that they have gone missing before with no one knowing.

## Melda Expidition (20 kya)
An unnatural and dangerous land that called all varieties of unnatural wildlife and mystery. Something about the land drew some people too it and more often then not those people began to corrupt and twist in some way.
The homeland of the [[Primordial Species#Gorken|Gorken]], culturally believed to be a cursed variation of the Mypans. Evolutionary they were a highly adaptable and generalist race that was able to wildly evolve. Though the dominant genes of the Mypan and Elves stabilized their genes into the **Orc Race** in the Eastern badlands (15 kya). Inconsistent splicing, inbreeding, inter-species relations and recessive genes did lead to several monster-like races.
- In the forests of the north, the **Bugbears** developed 
- In the southern cold, the **Hobgoblins and goblins** developed
- To the far-east, The remaining [[Primordial Species#Drakken|Drakken]], developed into **kobolds** (10 kya).
- In the North-western steppes, the **Centaurs** form into their tribes.
- In the central Mediterranean grassland, the **Minotaurs** form.

## Auften Settlement (18 kya)

## Cragmarian Strongholds (18 kya)

### North Cragmar (8 kya)

# Sunriel Incursion (12 kya)
