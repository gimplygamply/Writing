		- Abjurations weaken and necrotise
		- Illusions cause permanent perception damage. i.e. crippling hallucinations
		- Enhchanmtments warp the users personality almost always leaving them as husk-like robots.
		- Divinity causes the user to see to far into the divine. Often destroying their minds by literally witnessing the aspects.
		- Evocation reflects back at the user.
		- Transmutation malforms the user and twists them into some horrors.
		- Necromancy is the domain of Malazia, who will personally invoke a pin-sized blackhole to remove the user from existence.
		- Conjuration is a random teleporation, almost always into the black void of the universe.

- Magic is fickle and casting spells is strenuous. The skill of the caster is tied to their ability to cast under stressful situations.
	- Outside stress
		- Presence of wild magic
		- Combat
		- Generally stressful situations
		- Etyo Cloud
			- Magic is more powerful but more unstable.
			- Magic wielders can sense it
			- The size and density of the cloud determines the severity. Small clouds result in a little extra power to cast spells, while large clouds could mean that even a skilled caster can't safely cast higher-level spells safely.
			- The effects of these Etyo Surges can be random and are rolled from the d100 table corresponding to the spell type.
	- Stress exerted from the spell
		- Casting a spell is forming the Etyo around you into the desired outcome. Etyo is a living thing that resists it's transformation.
		- A persons magical capacity can be seen as a cup
			- the larger the cup the greater spells the can cast. 
			- The actual action of casting can seen as estimating the amount of Etyo that needs to be in your cup to cast. 
				- To underestimate is to waste your energy for a week or failed spell.
				- To overestimate is to release unconstrained Etyo into your spell resulting in a surge, or in extreme cases a blowout.
		- A more powerful spell calls for more Etyo, meaning low level spells are like trying to handle a mouse, while mid-level spells are like trying to handle a lion.
		- **Cantrips** require nearly zero skill to harness and in all but the most colossal Etyo clouds will interfere with them, even then a skilled caster could cast one with slight risk of surge.
		- **Rituals** are harmless unless cast in any cloud. Rituals are a constant eb and flow of Etyo, hence any minor discrepancy can disrupt the cast.
		- **Concentration** requires the caster to successfully begin the spell but once it's begun, managing the same Etyo is simple. Fluctuations and unintentional breaks in concentration can result in surges.
- Anyone with a touch of Etyo and the knowledge of the spell could cast max level spells. To channel that magic incorrectly would result in the Etyo violently bursting free, for higher tier magic, this burst is almost always lethal to an inexperienced caster.
# Etyo
[[Etyo]] is an omnipresent field in the universe, they are an imaginary ocean that fills the space between space. [[#Grail]] users are people that are born with a [[Etyo#Shards of Etyo|Shard of Etyo]], acting as a catalyst able to channel the Etyo around them. Through rigorous training this shards can be enhanced and fortified to endure longer and resist exertion from the absorption of Etyo from around them.

## Etyan Clouds
The [[Etyo#Fragments of Etyo|Fragment of Etyo]] litter the universe, their presence is of massive cosmic consequence but manifest to mortals as Etyan Clouds.

These clouds are the physical aura of a fragment and their unconstrained nature makes them hazardous to casters. The Etyo in this clouds will interfere in spell casting with great consequence.

## Harnessing Etyo
Etyo is a fickle, unstable material. It exists in a near uniform ocean in the universe, to harness it is to draw from that ocean and concentrate the extract into the form the caster desires.

The ocean of Etyo craves uniformity and resists it's manipulation and concentration by attempting to burst back out into itself. [[#Grail]] users are individuals capable of controlling the Etyo for long enough to shape the release into the desired result when the Etyo releases back into itself. An uncontrolled or unintentional release of Etyo will often have a grim result.
### Overflowing Etyo
To lose control of your Etyo is for it to overflow out of your Grail. A Grail calms the Etyo you harness and momentarily prevents it from exploding outwards back into itself. If your Grail does overflow, the Etyo is no longer contained and will violently return into itself. 

Any user can attempt to cast high-level magic, but the overflow almost inevitably 
#### Stress
Balancing the amount of Etyo required for a cast is an art that requires extreme precision. The exact amount of Etyo must be extracted and expended or else the spell will fail in the case of an over-utilization, under-utilization results in an excess of Etyo making it's way into the spell destabilizing it.
Most Grail users are capable of directing small overflows into [[#Surges]]. Large overflows form devastating [[#Blowouts]].

The stresses of battle, medical treatment and higher-level casting can often cause a Grail user to miscalculate and imprecisely utilize their Etyo. 
Additionally, [[#Etyan Clouds]] act sporadically and inconsistently, making it near impossible for a caster to precisely harness the Etyo. 

##### Surges
##### Blowouts
###### Influences on magic types
- **Cantrips**
- **Rituals**
- **Concentration**
### Grails
Grail users are said to harness a Grail. This Grail is the catalyst with which the caster can harness the Etyo around them.

It is named as such due to the action of "drinking from the Etyo around you".

A Grail is much like a muscle with drawing from the ocean of Etyo exerting it, trained and skilled Grail users are able to safely draw more frequently and larger amounts from the Etyo around them.

#### Divine Grails
	- Clerics and Paladins
These people are not born with the ability to manipulate Etyo, instead they are granted their powers by divine worship, in which the gods grant them their

#### Innate Grails
	 - Sorcerors and Wizards
##### Wizards
- Often have Etyan injuries from experimenting with Etyan overflow. Typically controlled markings and non-sever in most cases.
##### Sorcerors
- Often have severe Etyan injuries, generally from over-exertion and estimation from accidental Etyan overflow.
