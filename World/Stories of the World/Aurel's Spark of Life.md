- The Ylemen lineage made the [[Realm of Reality]]
- Linifa decided their Lineage would settle this realm.
- Linifa summoned all the Flesh into this Realm so that their Lineage may begin seeding it with life.
- This accidentally allowed Aurel's lifeless consciousness into the realm, unbeknownst to the deities.
	- Aurel's instinct to survive and the power imbued by the amalgamated viscera of [[Etyo]], allowed her to subconsciously guide herself to a sustainable orbit around a newly birthed star.
		- Done so by subtly manipulating Etya. Once again her survival instinct knew that her alien nature made her undetectable to the gods of this world but if they found her like this they could eventually erase her mind permanently.
- Aurel's mind, over a few megaannum, would become the seed crystal of the planet Auriga.
- In this time, her planet was seeded by the [[Antekedents]].
- In their final war the [[Antekedents]] fired off a super-weapon. Aurel's mind flung itself to the weapon at the instant of detonation. Completely absorbing it's power.
- The mind used the energy to harvest all biological life on the planet into an amniotic fluid. It peeled the blood-soaked crust of earth around itself and settled as the new small red-moon, [[Ki'nik]]. 
- The [[Linifan Lineage]] obviously investigated the strange event. To their shock and horror they discovered an entire planet that they simply didn't know existed.
	- They excused it, not having any life left to question.
- A few megaannums later, once the planet had faded from the minds of even the [[Linifan Lineage]], life evolved again.
	- The first men of [[Hawslit]] also began worshipping [[Ki'nik]] after accidentally learning how to sacrifice Grail Holders to it. Unknowingly bestowing it with power. 
- Eventually, the Aurigan's began developing Grails as they evolved. This alone was a natural part of life in this realm, but the inability of the [[Antekedents]] to use grails and the Aurigan's being able to drew the [[Linifan Lineage]] back to Auriga.
	- Aurel's mind and alien power allowed her to conceal herself from the Lineage.
- Once returned the Lineage decided this planet was to intriguing not to intervene in. Slowly they revealed all the Lineages to the people, confirming their existence and establishing magic and divine worship in the world.
- Now Aurel continues to grow in her womb.
