- The Ylemen lineage made the [[Realm of Reality]]
- Linifa decided their Lineage would settle this realm.
- Linifa summoned all the Flesh into this Realm so that their Lineage may begin seeding it with life.
- This accidentally allowed Aurel's lifeless consciousness into the realm, unbeknownst to the deities.
	- Aurel's instinct to survive and the power imbued by the amalgamated viscera of [[Etyo]], allowed her to subconsciously guide herself to a sustainable orbit around a newly birthed star.
		- Done so by subtly manipulating Etya. Once again her survival instinct knew that her alien nature made her undetectable to the gods of this world but if they found her like this they could eventually erase her mind permanently.
- Aurel's mind, over a few megaannum, would become the seed crystal of the planet Auriga.
- In this time, her planet was seeded by the [[Antekedents]].
- In their final war the [[Antekedents]] fired off a super-weapon. Aurel's mind flung itself to the weapon at the instant of detonation. Completely absorbing it's power.
- The mind used the energy to harvest all biological life on the planet into an amniotic fluid. It peeled the blood-soaked crust of earth around itself and settled as the new small red-moon, [[Ki'nik]]. 
- The [[Linifan Lineage]] obviously investigated the strange event. To their shock and horror they discovered an entire planet that they simply didn't know existed.
	- They excused it, not having any life left to question.
