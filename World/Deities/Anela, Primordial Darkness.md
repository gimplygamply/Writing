The primal Deity of darkness and patron of [[Malaiza]].

# Vested interest in Etyo
Being the patron of [[Malaiza]], she has a vested interest in returning all that exists to Malazia. Being a primordial, the control of Etyo frustratingly beyond her control is beyond her control. Though in the brief flutters of the universe that occur from necrotic magic, she is able to direct that Etyo into a proton sized black hole that immediately vaporizes the source, absorbing not just the Grail Holder but also their shard of Etyo, much to the satisfaction of Malazia.
