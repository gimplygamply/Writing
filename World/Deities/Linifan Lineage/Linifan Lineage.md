# Author's notes
- Hands-off policy
- Believe in self-governance of the species
- Refuse to involve themselves in the hand of mortals
- After [[Aurel's Spark of Life]], to avoid it happening again they exposed the people of Auriga to the divine through holy visions, undeniable miracles and occasionally copulating with them to create demi-god messiahs.
- (Due to Aurel's developing presence in [[Ki'nik]]) The people of Auriga were able to study Etya exceptionally. This attracted the other lineage to witness the study themselves.
