Creation is not a dead, but it is no longer a god, rather it has become an underlying force. An instinct driven concept forever harvesting the scraps created from the eternal battle between "Known" and "Unknown" to put "Existence" into the universe.

## Forms
### Existence
The force given to all things created by "Creation", this power is the raw concept that glues the navigable world. The perceivable reality in which science, magic, the inanimate and life is the result of existence.
### Glue
The weak and strong force, the fundamental forces holding our world together.
