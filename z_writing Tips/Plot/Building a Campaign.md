>It's a lot like growing a tree, fundamentally your actually growing a tree in some horrific N dimensional universe and you need to maintain that tree across all dimensions. Not to mention each dimension is strongly correlated to all the others with each influencing the other tree's pasts, futures and presents. (It might make sense later) 

# Tips
## Start Small and build up
>A tree doesn't start as a thick trunk and simply extrudes into the sky. It starts thin and dainty, and it grows layers upon layers, never destroying it's previous self but leaving the signs of previous rings inside.

Designing a plot for a local conflict about two farmers arguing over the ownership of a  chicken is far more intimate and manageable. You don't need to have the entire thing figured out to start writing. But from this little dispute perhaps this is the root of your warring kingdoms a century later.

## Worldbuilding Vs Campaign writing
There is some serious overlap between the two. A ton of tips will apply to both.
Remember, 'worldbuilding' is telling the story of what's already there. 'Campaign Writing' is putting down the pathways your plays will follow through that world

### Leave room
This is a key reason we start small. You WILL have good ideas as you write that you wouldn't have thought about when worldbuilding, make sure you don't corner yourself before hand.

## Forget about details until the end
**MAKE IT EXIST THEN MAKE IT GOOD**

You don't need an entire 2000 yr history for a fishing village. Everything should have a history and a culture (Refer to [[Make a culture]]) but at least for the very beginning just start with the core fundamentals.

### Remember your Axioms
>This is where your tree meets the earth, the very thing the tree grows upon.

Think of physics and mathematics, all derivations and proofs are all rooted in a handful of core axioms. Define your concept by a set of Axioms and construct everything off of that.
Start at the bottom and work your way up, establish a foundation:

#### An axiom by definition is the simplest possible form
>One can never see the roots of a tree, they are buried deep in the earth.

This means that to discover it's cause/reason is a literal reality shattering discovery and as such to reveal it could potentially shatter you world. If you cannot justly establish or create value from the discovery, **DON'T REVEAL IT**. 

> To see a trees roots means you have either pulled out the stump, thus killing the tree, or spent exorbitant amounts of effort carefully excavating to peek at them. 
##### Use with care
In real-life we seek the cause of things to better understand things and to harness them, your reader/players will not care why your world is flat unless that somehow serves them.
>==Example==
You could feature a character that is trying desperately trying to grow their magical power. To them, the study of magic and it's history would hold unbelievable value. However, the value of this insight would need to be established greatly and it would need to be decently fleshed out to be be able to create and realize it's value. 

 In general it's extremely difficult to do and should generally be avoided unless it's a key component, It's unlikely to work apart from a main focus and trying to apply it as a 'side quest' would be an extravagant undertaking. 
##### Examples
1. **Axiom**: "Magic is rare but no unheard of"
   Potential **Consequences**:
	- This means that people will worship/fear/kill/exile magic users.
	- Some cultures may even deny it's existence.
	- The field of magic may be under-developed.
	- Science/technology may be more powerful than magic in some fields.
	
2. **Axiom**: "The continent is ancient but it's discovery is new"
   **Consequences**:
	- The new inhabitants are extremely superstitious.
	- Majority of the population is concentrated in certain regions, generally near the coastline.
	- Pioneer towns and settlements could exist in ideal locations but are extremely isolated from the world.
	- There could be natives
		- Either descendants of some survivors of an extinction event
		- A secluded, advanced/primitive, isolationist civilization has claimed hold of the region. 
		- A wild race, devolved from the original inhabitants.

# Guide
This is the general process I'd suggest trying and adjusting to suit you.
You should repeat each step for every level (i.e. Universe->world(s)->continent(s)->country/ies->capital(s)->city/ies->Town(s)->Village(s), this can be applied to biomes, history, cultures and basically anything that required some amount of time to develop)

The highest level of the branches should begin as the simplest possible descriptors, [[#Remember your Axioms]], beginning with something ridiculously simple will maintain consistency across your entire universe and story. Once you have reached the final branches of your story tree (i.e the villages/settlements), begin applying details that propagate back to the root of the tree.
> **Example** of how to grow you 'tree'
> Select a root and a leaf and reinforce the branch:
> 	- **Root**: Magic users are rare
> 	- **Leaf**: A village has settled in a completely isolated region of the continent
>  Why is the region isolated? -> It behind a nearly impassable mountain ->
>  Why would the villager settle here? -> because it started as a refugee camp ->
>  Why was there a refugee camp? -> Two countries went to war and the local farmers ->
>  Why did they go to war? -> Country A suffered an epidemic and wanted Countries B's holy clerics to serve them ->
>  Why did they want the clerics? -> Magic users are scarce in this universe and therefore highly valued

>Just remember that a tree should be thinner the closer to the leaves and thickens as you move towards the base. If you're unable to adequately reinforce a connection, consider either trying to seek a different root-of thought (Get it?). 

Keep reminding yourself to [[#Start Small and build up]], the simplest and rawest ideas should be able to be moulded into nearly anything so it's likely that rather than discarding an idea entirely you may have just over thought it on creation and need to simplify it and try again.

## Create the physical setting
### Define where it takes place
You won't get far in your world if there is no world. Create your tree, establish the universe, the planet, the continents and so on until you finally reach the beginning point of your journey. It's not a requirement but the further down the branch you start the better, the details you define here will propagate not just too the the parent but every descendant of this point.  

This is were you should finally begin laying out your details, this is where those other dimensions of the tree come into play, your town should have it's own culture and history to bring it to life. as I cannot re-iterate enough **START SIMPLE**, don't let the freedom of details get to your head, as I've said before, go in layers. The smallest leaves propagate deep into the trunk, overly complex stories quickly become difficult and arduous to mould into the final product and having to go back to revert them can be equally as complex.

> **Example**
> The city of Anker was historically a naval port (leaf), acting as a supply station for the old kings warships (Tie to a branch, creates historical and cultural establishment). This legacy has resulted in a fearsomely industrious and proud population (cultural result). After the end of the Da'sad between the lizardfolk, the navy was seen as secondary and saw many of the resources Anker previously enjoyed sent to the city of Interen, resulting in an unfriendly rivalry (historical result). 
> \[All the establishments and results aren't strictly required, do what you want but try make it make sense... if you want to]

## Define the immediate situation and it's past
For a DnD campaign, you're essentially creating an mystery/situation for your players to solve and for you to watch. Mysteries/situations don't strictly have a correct answers and trying to set one will only bias you into railroading them to your chosen result. So do try avoid it unless you're intending to railroad your players.

In order for your players to solve the mystery/situation, you must understand the situation entirely. Don't try anticipate the players actions, rather just tell a story to your self. 
In fact I'd encourage you write the story of the incident as your own little short book.
### Fishing for herring \[Example]


## Establish your clocks
Time is the ultimate engine and you can use it to:
- To naturally and fairly punish the party for not dedicating to the problem (**Note**: Only when deserved, if your party is consistently not interested in your stories then you might need to reflect on the plot a bit).
- To progress the plot without relying on the direct actions of the party. For DnD this is critical as there is no telling what your party may do and 'checkpoints' can often be missed. 
	- You can use checkpoint but they should rather activate different routes in the plan, not be markers for progress of the plot.
- Create a sense of desperation and/or urgency among the party.

### How to make clocks
Recall [[#Define the immediate situation and it's past|When you defined what happened]]? You wrote a story that ended where the players intervened. These clocks are basically the continuation of that plot if you'd ignore the players intervention.
You're essentially writing the story that is about to happen and the results of it happening.

#### Example

## Maintain the "Now" facts
Similar to the clocks, the facts of the over-arching story must still be present. Improvisation is a key component of DnD, but the key to a good story is that it never seems like you're improvising.
Ideally you fool your party into thinking you're an ultra-genius mastermind and you've anticipated their every move (Don't let it get to your head).

### How to track the facts
This is functionally identical to the clocks and very closely related. However the now facts require a few tricks.
#### simplicity (Again)
Once again, extreme intricacies will inevitably end in you and your players getting frustrated as they're having to solve a ridiculous puzzle requiring a biblical level of planning all the while you're losing your patience that they're struggling. Simplicity allows you freedom to improvise and adapt while still maintaining the structure of your story.

The goal isn't to anticipate the players every move, the goal is to leave just enough breadcrumbs for the players to follow.

##### Example
- Situation
	- The players are hunting down a local smuggler to find out where to buy weapons in the city.
- Facts:
	- The smuggler is a shift manager at the dockyard. He lives in a workers accommodation in his own room
	- The smuggler works at the dockyard during the week, relaxes in the river district during the weekend.
	- At night he uses an abandoned sewer east of the dockyard to set out in a small row boat.
