The villain shouldn't just threaten the world, they should reveal it. 
The scariest threat isn't just random chaos, it's the truth hidden by the world/society.
# Ways to make the villain have more oomph
- Give them personal ties to each character.
- Make them on the same side as the characters but in a corrupted form.
- Do not give the characters any reason to want to align with them.
- Give them characters a reasons to hate them, sympathize with them and understand them.
	- Blind hate and comedic villainy doesn't inspire the feeling of opposition, more like righteousness.
- Allow them to have irrationality, they MUST have a goal but they don't require a good reason.
	- i.e. A lover seeking revenge on the world for their dead partner won't have/need a good reason to kill everyone, but they must be doing it to honour/revive their lover.
- Make them a friend before an enemy.
- Make them the Hero in their eyes.
- If they're a calm and calculated villain, make them slip up when they get angry or their goal is within reach.
- Give them an aesthetic
- Have the villain target something the characters hold dear.
