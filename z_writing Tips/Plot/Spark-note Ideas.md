# Sad
Nothing will feel sad unless the happiness/importance/value is established before hand 

- Have to give up an item of huge emotional importance
- Leader abandoned by his own people
- Redemption arc that comes a little too late
- Making a mistake that's to big to be forgiven
- Unrequited love with a childhood best friend
- betrayal by a sibling, parent or child
- Realizing who they truly love when  it's too late
- Not being believed by those closest to them
- The sacrifice being for nothing
- Never getting closure after failing to protect them.
- Spending their life fighting for a false promise
- Being left behind while badly injured.
-
