# The transformation of a world into a dystopia
Dystopia's are created from 3 archetypes:
- Murder
	- The eradication of the world with the survivors left to pick up the pieces
- Monarchs
	- The leaders of the world continue to usurp and grow their personal wealth and power, eventually resulting in a world entirely controlled by the ruling elite
- Madness
	- The true horrors of the world are exposed
	- The population is gently shifted towards crueller and more depraved rituals and culture until they have completely sunk into the unrecoverable pits of depravity.

An antagonist that enacted the 3 archetypes in order, firstly by form of genocide. Plummeting the world into disarray and leaving the survivors in a state of disarray and anarchy.
The antagonist embodies a monarch, uniting the survivors under a united banner, promising prosperity and rebirth. Only to consolidate power, strip the populace and ascend to a god-like status.
Lastly, the now god-like being enacts policy and change to drive the people towards a world of doubt, hatred and fear. They do it through, conspiracy/religion/cult-ish worship, before finally tipping the scale and allowing the population to devolve into a barbaric animals ruled by fear, hatred and madness. No longer human.
