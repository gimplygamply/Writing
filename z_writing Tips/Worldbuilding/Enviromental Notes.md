# Winds and Shared Biome Influence
![[Auriga Winds.png]]
- Wind plays a major role in setting biomes, fauna and flora of a region as well as their aspect.
	- Irl a plant from Peru dies in Canada but a plant from Spain grows in america, same for animals 
	- People from the same regions also develop along the same regions adapt better to each other. (See Europe)
		- It's more likely that people in the same region will adapt together.
- Where cells meet (Red and Blue Hor. lines) Maritime barriers are created. These spots have low or stagnant wind making ship travel extremely slow.
- The Directions of winds also influence how ships travel, You generally sale in the direction of the winds.
- **Cyclones and Hurricanes** are around 5-20 Degrees either side of the the equator and make land fall in the direction of the prevailing wind.
- **Thunder storms** basically anywhere with:
	- cold air moving into warm moist air (Equator and central North and South Hemispheres). 
	- All the Conversion zones (Horizontal lines)
	- Mountainous Regions
- **Tornadoes** occur between the 30-50 Degree region in the north and south. Generally caused by turbulence from the diverging winds across land.
	- Primarily occurs when Moist warm air flows towards cold dry air (In this case South Sternia and Hawslit will experience a decent amount)

# Ocean Currents
![[Auriga Ocean Currents.png]]
- Effects the rate of exploration, as travelling by currents is how most island discoveries are made.
- Cold current carry nutrients, they make for excellent fishing hotspots.
- Warmer currents increase rain.
- Tropical regions with warm currents give way to coral reefs.

# Metals and Resources
## Coal
- Formed in ancient, low-oxygen tropical growths. These growths would be from warmer periods of the planet.
- The biomass that died didn't decay due to the low oxygen and instead got buried under other biomass. This led to.
	1.  Peat (Surface Level): Compacted organic matter, about 50% carbon. Found in modern low-lying wetlands.
	2. Lignite/Brown Coal (4-10km) ~60% C: Found in flat regions in fragmented plates
	3. Bituminous/Black coal ~70%C: Found at the feet of foothills
	4. Anthracite ~90% C: Found at the foot of mountains
	5. Graphite (High pressure i.e mountains) 100% C found under mountains
## Metals
- **Two forms**: Native and Mineral.
- Native is the raw resource
- Minerals are rocks that contain traces of the metal, minerals with high enough concentration are called an ore. Ore deposits are just large groupings or Ore.
- **Placing them**
	- Coastal (Young) Mountain Ranges (more ocean facing).
		- Mainly copper deposits
			- Copper
			- Copper-Gold
			- Copper Molybdenum
			- Molybdenum
		- In all cases with small amounts of lead zinc and silver
		- Few Tin-Tungsten Deposits
		- Epithermal Gold
			- Gold (w/silver and copper), close to copper deposits
			- Gold (w/ silver, Lead, Zinc), slightly further from copper
			- Gold (w/ silver, Mercury), even further out from copper
	- Coastal (Young)  Mountain Ranges (Internal and continental facing)
		- Iron-Copper-Gold, Formed long-ago and have drifted further
			- Small amounts of Uranium
	- Stable interior regions of continent
		- Nickel-Copper (Semi-Common)
		**RARE**
		- Platinum
		- Palladium
		- Rhodium
		- Ruthenium
		- Osmium
		- Iridium
		**ULTRA-RARE**
		- Diamond
	- In all mountains (Young and Old)
		- Copper-Zinc w/ minor amounts of:
			- Lead, silver gold Cobalt, Tin, Selenium, Manganese, Cadmium
	- In old Mountains (Interior)
		- Iron
	- In continental sedimentary basins (Wear water and sediment gather)
		- Lead, Zinc and Silver (Uncommon)
	- In rain forests and wet regions
		- Aluminium
- Secondary-Enrichment deposits (When water washes into an existing deposit carrying it a short distance to make a new one)
	- A few of these at the base of high up deposits
	- Largest Uranium deposit will be one of these
- MVT deposits (When water seeps into a mountain range, dissolves metals and carries them down into the soil to form new deposits)
	- Happens commonly so have a few of these
	- Place them 100s of km away from start positions.
- Placer deposits
	- When native deposits erode into a river and get carried down into a new deposit (Panning for gold/diamond etc)
