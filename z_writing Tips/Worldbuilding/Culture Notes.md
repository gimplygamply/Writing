1. Keep it simple
	- The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
	- Avoid deviating from standard rectangle unless there is a reason for it.
2. Use meaningful symbolism
	- The flag's images, colours, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.
	- Avoid having things face away from the flagpoles, right facing animals are seen as a symbol of cowardice (Can be twisted for different cultures)
3. Use 2-3 Basic colours
	- Limit the number of colours on the flag to three, which contrast well and come from the standard colour set.
	- Light on dark, dark on light and light separating dark (Vice versa).
	- More is allowed in cases of symbolism and contrast.
4. No lettering on seals
	- Never use writing of any kind or an organization's seal.
	- **NEVER EVER HAVE PLAIN TEXT**
5. Be distinctive or be related
	- Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connection
	- Your design should be distinctive from both front and back.
