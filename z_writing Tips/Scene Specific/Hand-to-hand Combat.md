# Bare-knuckle fighting
- Very rare as a form of consistent combat. 
- It draws blood, knuckles are sharp.
- The same amount of force is exerted on the knuckles as on the target. It takes an experienced fighter to be prepared and adapted to the pain.
- Open-hand strikes are ridiculously strong in comparison.
- Well-trained fighter don't bunch, they grapple.
	- They will lock and lever their opponent.
# Pain is real
- People don't just grit through it.
- you can't just NOT react to it.
	- You may have a constitution to lessen the mental effect but you WILL be hurt and WILL instinctively react.
- Adrenaline is the exception.
	- The person must actually feel their life is at threat before it activates.
	- A person under it's effect WILL not stop until the fight has drawn on beyond the hormones effect or the person has been incapacitated.
# Anymore than one opponent (two for a skilled fighter) is nearly a guaranteed loss
- Almost all fighting styles and weapons are adapted for one-on-one with the exception of most polearms which exploit distance to focus multiple targets safely.
# Fitness, skill and weapon types play significant roles in several situations.
- **Fitness**: Influences not only the resistance to damage but also the ability to persist through injury (i.e. A fit fighter is more likely to be standing after leg-damage due to the variety of supporting muscles to compensate for the damage). The severity of physical attacks is also affected by this.
- **Skill/Experience**: Skill effects the persons mental fortitude in battle. The higher the skill the more likely they are able to persist through injury and attacks by either adjusting their style or by understanding their limits (i.e. a skilled fighter will be able to continue the fight with their left-arm even if they're right is injured, whereas an unskilled fighter may forfeit).
- **Armed combatants won't just use their weapon**, they will kick, they will kick, punch and head butt given the chance.
## Shields and Armour
- Shields and armour don't negate impact, they mitigate it by dispersing it over a greater area.
	- Some force is still applied to the arm and depending on that force, injury can still occur.
	- Wooden shields absorb more but are relatively fragile
	- Metal shields are more durable but also transfer more energy to the user (This is why most were plated in hide to help with absorption).
- Most armour crumbles to bludgeoning weapons and shield handle terrible against flails and curved weapons.
## Slashing Blades
- slashing blades are **TERRIBLE** against armour.
### Blade-to-blade combat
- They require serious maintenance after short scuffles and possible full replacement after prolonged/heavy bout.
- The blades of weapons are relatively soft to allow for sharper edges and better penetrating/slashing capability.
- Single-edged swords are better as the flat, hardened sides can be used to take the impact.
## Piercing weapons
- A skilled wielder will make use of the range
	- For swords such as rapiers they will continually dance and keep moving to create distance
- These weapons also make use of thrusts not only as attacks but also as deterrents to keep the attacker in their preferred range.
