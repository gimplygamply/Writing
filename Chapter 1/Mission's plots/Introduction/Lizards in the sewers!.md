## Plot
### Introduction
- The sun rises on a warm Aurigan morning as you gather in the [[Warrior's Retreat]] courtyard.
- A Dwarven Clerk, [[#Dolgi Orcfoe]], stands on a stool beneath the statue of the founder of [[Warrior's Retreat]] delegating the work the guild is offering.

> [!NOTE] Dolgi's Announcement
> - After lingering for a while in the warm morning sun, your attention is drawn to a Dwarf—congenial in both figure and attire. In one hand, he waves a parchment covered in messy handwriting; in the other, a copper speaking trumpet, which he raises to his mouth before bellowing out his commands.
> - “Oi, listen up! Here’s the work for today! Most o’ you know what you signed up for, so this should go quick. Thornold and Imenrial, you two are headed to Kelmer’s Farm to help with the fox problem—be there by midday. They’ll get you sorted.”
> - A middle-aged Gnomish man draped in furs, and a pale, tattooed Elven woman break from the crowd and stride toward the city gate. As your eyes follow them, you’re distracted by a group of scantily clad Dwarves dressed in what seems to be traditional warrior garb. They snicker and trade crude jokes as the pair pass by. The Gnome marches on undisturbed, but the Elf throws them a cold, scornful glare. One remark floats through the laughter: “Bet he’s taller lying down.”
> - The clerk waits for the pair to be out of earshot before continuing. “Right then, lads—” he glances at his notes, hesitating, “—Prax’s boys?”
> - Before he can say another word, the group of Dwarves erupts into a cheer, hooting and clapping for a solid half-minute. The clerk eventually quiets them down with a raised hand. “Good to see some of you young folk have… character. You’ve got the Stoln Security job—head to the shipyard, they’ll sort you out there.”
> - The rowdy Dwarves depart, exchanging banter and good-natured jabs. As the noise fades and you find yourselves the last group remaining in the courtyard, the clerk lowers his speaking trumpet and addresses you in a dry, matter-of-fact tone:
> - “You’re here about the investigation work, yeah? Come inside so I can sit down—I’ll explain what you’ll be doing for us.”
- The office is illuminated by natural light coming from the window next to the door. Directly across from the door in the corner of the room is an unlit fireplace, In the opposite corner, an office chair sits tucked behind pine desk. A large book case looms behind the guest chairs, tucked beside the window.
- The clerk seats himself and plants the notes onto the desk. He waits for the party to enter and begins to explain the job. 

> [!NOTE] The Job
> "So long story short, there's been quite a hefty spike in crimes around the city, mainly [[Riven]], and the Guards are occupied with the summer traders bringing in the trouble. You job is to head to [[Riven]] and figure out what's going on, you can go to other parts of the city but we mostly reckon that's a waste." 
> He takes a pause and flips the parchment, takes a deep breath and continues on, "Here's the brass tax:
>  - If we can't confirm your findings you'll be fined a sum equal to double your deposit.
>  - If it's just the usual crowd acting up, we'll give you each 5 SP.
>  - If you can get a solid culprit we'll give you each 1 GP for the info and another 1 GP each if we can confirm it all.
>  - Stay out of the guards way but if you need their help take this Warrior's Certificate."
>  He pulls a paper from a pile, signs it, stamps it, folds it and presents it to you.
>  - " it'll give you a bit more credibility with the guards. Oh and please do try boss a guard around with it, I'll be laughing when they call me to fetch you from the stockade.
>  - And lastly if you can bring in a culprit we'll give you a bounty equivalent to their crimes, but only if they're alive for a public execution."
>    He glances at you each from left to right, meeting each of your gazes to gauge whether you understand him. He nods his head in satisfaction and finalizes the speech with "Well as long as none of you speak elvish, you should know what to do head on."

### Act 1
- The party makes their way to the edge of [[Riven]] unscathed and unbothered. However, once having arrived at the outskirts of [[Riven]] the party will immediately be accosted by a female Human street vendor, [[#Ella Redstream]], trying to sell them paper flowers. See [[#Flower salesman]].
#### What's going on around here
See [[#DM Notes]] for quick summary.
- The party can begin their investigation anywhere in Riven, for each hour in Riven, roll from the [[#Good 'ol Riven]] event table.
- The people of Riven are aware of the on-going crime wave. 
	- (DC1-9) Most report tid-bits disappearing such as pots, boots and kitchen knives.
	- (DC10-14) Some reports are more extreme such as hearing break-ins to food related businesses.
	- (DC15-17) A guard admits that he heard a fellow guard had their short sword lifted straight from it's scabbard while he was taking a piss.
	- (DC18-20) The party hears a report of a local bakers boy, ==Asher Hillless==, that was stabbed two nights before. 
		- The person they're hearing from was definitely at the murder scene to see what happened.
		- The person don't have a lot of information but they were just at the scene.
		- The person mentions that ==Asher== was a kind soul especially to the beggars and often would give them the unsold stock from the bakers.
		- The person says that there was a witness but people aren't sure who.
		- The person will point the party to the bakery where the crime happened.
- Once the party have gotten the baker's lead, they can proceed there and begin investigating.
- Once at the bakery the players will notice it has been shutdown, at least temporarily.
	- The front door is barred from within making access impossible, a DC 21 Strength check can break it down.
	- The back door can be accessed from the alley-way, it is simply locked and can be picked with a DC11 Sleight-of-Hand check.
	- There is a staircase to the upstairs apartment that belonged to ==Asher==, the apartment is locked, and can be picked with a DC8 Sleight-of-Hand check.
		- There is nothing of value in the apartment as it was cleared by the landlord (the baker).
		- There is an unlocked inner staircase to enter the kitchen.
	- In the back-alley there exists a makeshift tent and bedding. It holds nothing of value besides a rucksack filled with ragged clothes. The tarp is pinned down with rocks and pinned up with some wooden boards. It doesn't look very sturdy. This is [[Endinwel Talthanryl]]'s 'home'.
- The party should investigate inside or around the bakery.

> [!NOTE] Inside the Bakery
>  Entering the bakery, despite the efforts of the cleaners it's very apparent some break-in occurred. The damages seems mostly accidental: broken glass where too much weight was applied, utensils that had likely fallen being placed in piles out of the way and scratches on the floorboards.
>  The exception to this pattern is the back entry way, the stains of blood have seeped into the floorboards leaving the aged pine splattered with dark-brown splotches.
- [[Endinwel Talthanryl]] notices the presence of people inside or around the bakery and flings himself towards them thinking "the lizards" are back.

> [!NOTE] Endinwel's arrival
> The sounds of a small limping buffalo approach you from around the corner. If you weren't in the middle of the city you'd swear a bear was charging you.
> You stand primed and ready for some attack, your hands preparing to launch for your weapons. Yet your instincts are whiplashed away when, after a half-moment of silence, a slurred war-cry screeches around the corner "Com 'en ge' a square go". 
> Without a moment to process, what you first mistake for a ghoul flies through the doorway, wooden plank in both hands clutched like a great sword. The ghostly figure manages to charge about a meter before he loses his stability with the planking landing on his face. Seeming to stun him for a moment.
- [[Endinwel Talthanryl]] is suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal. Identifiable with a DC 14 Medicine check.
	- He is pale, sweating and shaking uncontrollably.
	- He can speak but in somewhat slurred speech.
	- He is also a mess emotionally.
- He takes a moment to recover but eventually recognizes the party aren't 'lizards'.
- At first he is apologetic for his outburst explaining that he was trying to protect ==Asher's== work place and had thought that "the lizard men" had returned to finish ransacking the bakery. He mentions that he was present the night of the murder, he starts to get depressive.
	- The party can press him for details but as he's made to recount it he will break further.
		- He will first reveal that he was questioned by the guards and that he had been the one to find the body. 
			- A DC 11 insight check reveals that he's partly telling the truth but he has shame.
			- After revealing this point, Endinwel will start to build tears in his eyes.
		- Next he will reveal that he saw the guards sneak a weapon from the scene he doesn't know why.
			- A DC 6 Insight check reveals he's lying, he knows why. The heavily damaged short sword but it looked like it had a city-guard hand-guard. The guards don't want people to think they're involved and further more he will slip mentioning that they definitely aren't.
			- He will catch himself becoming more frantic and trying to shut himself up.
		- Further pushing, he will finally snap and begin a rant explaining what he saw.

> [!NOTE] Lizards in the sewers!
> "It was a whole gang of the fuckers, they scurried like rats. When that poor fucker swung open the door, he was covered in them and their pointy bits like mosquitos. He kept screaming so loud, I could hear it every time I was staring at the bottom of a bottle."
> Snot, sweat and tears run down his face as he takes a pause to catch his breath, heavily panting. He opens his mouth to speak-- but before he can speak he turns to the side, vomits and collapses to the ground before muttering. 
> "The lizards got him, and I just watched."
- A DC 6 Medicine check reveals he's in the near-final stages of withdrawal and seems to have gone catatonic. It should be clear he still has more information but is no condition to speak. He will need treatment.
	- A magical healing spell will instantly recover him to consciousness but not completely out of withdrawal.
		- If the party don't have a healing spell, they can seek the help of a cleric at the cost of 4 GP.
	- A DC12 medicine check, a days rest and 2 full meals he will recover to a state capable of speaking and become more stable.
	- Cruelly, the players could feed him alcohol, this will end his recovery and start his [[Endinwel Talthanryl#Alcoholism Arc|Alcoholism Arc]].
- **If he recovers, begin his [[[[Endinwel Talthanryl#Recovery Arc|Recovery Arc]]**.
- Once recovered, although hazy, he is able to provide the coherent series of events.
	- He, with much shame was passed out drunk, in his own vomit and piss. He had been blacked out for quite a while and had suddenly been woken up by the screams of ==Asher==.
	- His eyes peeled open to see this writhing blob like form standing in the door way, at first he thought some beast was lumbering towards him, that's where the piss came from.
	- After ==Asher== fell to the ground, it became clear these creatures, they looked lizard-like and carried weapons. They scuttled away and ran off with their loot.
	- He crawled away from the alley to try run from the guards but was easily apprehended as the first suspect. His condition and the lack of blood-stains that would've been created by such a violent murder ruled him out as a suspect and he became the key witness.
	- The guards questioned him inside the building after spending a long time trying to sober him up. He felt special, being given water and fed even for the few questions he could answer, when he stepped out he could see the looks of shame people where shooting at him and he realized how horrible he had been.
	- He mentions that he saw a bloody short sword in the room but after being questioned it was gone and the guards were scuttling around. Soon he saw a senior guard having a whispered argument with a giant guard before he saw the glint of metal and the Goliath tucking the sword into a bundle in his armor.
	- Finally, he mentions that there was a weird smell of algae in the room, he's able to relate it to the smell of the streets just after rain.
- He apologizes for the scene and for not being able to help further but he's done the best he can.
### Act 2
#### Finding the big man
- The party will likely try find the guard, [[Wolfen Sten]], he is one of the very few Goliaths in all of [[Praint]]. 
- Him being a Goliath has led to some people predisposing him to be a violent barbarian, that combined with his socially frowned upon interracial marriage to his Half-Elf wife, [[Catherine deGrey]], has led to him being reclusive and rarely leaving his home apart from work.
- The best course of action is the utilize the Warrior's certificate and approach a guard for information.
	- The easiest giveaway would be to mention that they're looking for a goliath. [[Wolfen Sten]] is easily the only Goliath guard and at least known as 'the big-man'.
	- For the most part none of the guards know who [[Wolfen Sten]] is as he's very new to the guard, but they're all able to direct the party to [[Somer Barracks]] where they will be able to help them further.
##### The search
###### The barracks and Guards
- Once at [[Somer Barracks]], the party is greeted by the large wooden castle style gate of the barracks, the gate is flanked by 2 guards.
- Approaching the 2 guards, the party will be guided to the guard service desk where they could ask further questions.
- To the side of the main gate is a sturdy wooden service door on a foot path.
	- A row of 3 large desks sit at the far end of the room, three wood panel dividers separate the desks as well as waist high door. Two guest stools are placed at each table. Two of the three desks are occupied by a clerk.
	- At the entryway is a guard seated in the corner on a stool, he's flirting with a young woman who has pulled up one of the waiting stools to accompany him.
	- More guest stools sit around the room, there are a very small group of people waiting for service.
- The players can try approach the clerks but will be yelled at by the other citizens waiting their turn if they try skip the lines. if the players cause a scene the guard in the corner will keep them in order.
	- Any rudeness or lack of use of the certificate will result in the party being forced to wait with the other people and any further escalation will result in the party being kicked out.
- The Warrior's Certificate will give the players a rush to the front as long as they aren't rude. The clerks will also tell the party that the goliaths name is [[Wolfen Sten]] and he lives in [[Stel]] with the square roof.
###### The barber
- If the party botched the approach at [[Somer Barracks]], they can attempt to find more information of the guard. 
- Being a goliath, after about a maximum of one hour to find that there is a Half-Elf barber who operates out of [[Stel]] who the goliath has been seen regularly visiting.
- Once at the barber the players will undoubtedly meet [[Catherine deGrey]]. She will not reveal to be [[Wolfen Sten]]'s wife but will arrange for [[Wolfen Sten]] to be at the barber at:
	- **If the party arrive in the morning** Wolfen will be at the shop in the evening.
	- **If the party arrives in the evening** Wolfen will arrive the same time the next time.
- A DC14 insight check will reveal that [[Catherine deGrey]] is leaving out a very important piece of information relating to her and [[Wolfen Sten]]'s relationship .
- At the designated meeting time, Wolfen arrive and question why the party is looking for him. If they can provide a satisfactory answer, he will guide the party to his house and they will continue the conversation.
- Alternatively, the party could follow them until they find their home. The party shouldn't know that the two are married and live together.
#### The who and the what?
[[Wolfen Sten]] is friendly by nature while [[Catherine deGrey]] is far more abrasive to strangers when in company with her husband. In day-to-day there nature is swapped to better suit their expectations and to protect their social status.
- The house is a 2-story apartment building. 
	- The entry way to the the first floor faces the back alley with the second floor stair case beginning in the side alleyway but wrapping around to the back. Cat and Wolf stay on the second floor.
	- Standing at the front of the building, the party can see the stair well from the main road. 
	- Beneath a shattered window, the wooden stair railing is splintered and cracked downward.
		- A DC6 Investigation check reveals that something heavy landed on it
		- A DC10 Investigation check reveals that the object slammed against a cobble on the ground.
			- Investigating the cobble further shows that it's clear there is a chip, the stone beneath the weathered surface is exposed.
			- A DC14 perception check reveals a green-red blood splotch.
	- The stairs wrap around to the back alley unto a balcony entry-way leading into the top floor apartment.
	- The building seems to have originally been a house and a stairway was neatly added as a way to split the building into an apartment.
- If the party arrive uninvited, either by following or by using the information given by the guards barracks. Wolfen (or if he is not home, Catherine) will be hesitant, or depending on the condition of the parties arrival, even hostile.
- If the party is able to see within the apartment, they can easily make out a break-in.
	- The door lock is intact but a DC 10 investigation check reveals the latch and screws are brand new.
	- Most of the furniture is properly organized and shaped, apart from the obvious spice shelf with it's back against the broken window, A DC 14 perception check will reveal that most furniture is slightly out of place and has just been cleaned up.
- Eventually, Wolfen will warm to the party and be willing to answer some simple questions.
- Relating to the sword:
	- He will require some convincing since he's actually lost the sword and although it was not of great importance to the case, he would be embarrassed to lose it.
	- The sword was city forged for the guard.
	- If prompted he will elaborate that the guard is extremely occupied with trade season and that Riven is on the bottom of the priority list. Riven clearly isn't pleased with it, so if a guard sword were found at the scene it would be a torch in a powder keg.
	- The sword had a wooden pin roller as a handle and the pommel mount had simply been bent to loosely keep the handle on. It would've barely been usable but judging by the boys wounds, it was probably the highest quality weapon the robbers had.
	- Regardless, the sword is gone there was a break in the night before the party arrived.
- Wolfen will elaborate about the break-in if asked:
	- He couldn't see what happened exactly but they woke up to this ruckus in the kitchen, it was a clear thud like something had fallen.
	- His guard instincts kicked in and he flew out of the bed into the kitchen.
	- He reached for his dagger but it wasn't in its scabbard. He snapped back to see the creatures swarm to the door.
	- Thinking on his feet, he tried to incapacitate one of the creatures with a tackle as they fled. He ran full speed into the final one with a shoulder tackle. In the moment he thought it best to do but as he approached the creature he noticed the creatures small size and pivoted to a knee kick.
	- After his knee connected with the creatures jaw, he realized he'd overdone it when a loud crack reverberated through the room. Even Catherine heard it from the room (She will only comment if the party is trusted by them).
	- The small creature crashed through the window, followed by wood creaking and a thud of bone on rock.
	- He ran to see out the window, he watched the creatures drag the injured one deeper into the back alley.
	- He ran outside to catch them but by the time he was down they'd managed to disappear without a trace, he ran as fast as he could, given the size difference and his athletic ability there was no chance they'd outrun him.
	- he spent a while running through the alley to see if he'd missed anything but found nothing. He returned home to see what was stolen. Nothing of value was taken but their pantry, his dagger and the short sword from the scene were robbed.
- He apologizes for not being able to help more but mentions that he can show the party where he last saw the creatures.
- he will guide the party outside to the back alley where he last saw the creatures. The alley is a roughly T-shaped junction, the ally is very cramped and bare of interest. The only feature of the alley is a sewer grate.
	- A DC10 investigation check reveals the grit around the grate has been disturbed, something moved the grate recently.
- The party can investigate but won't find anything different than the previous investigation check above.

		-  If the party are extra reluctant, she will offer them a three for two special but will take the money and only give them two flowers before trying to run away.
